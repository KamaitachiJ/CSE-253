# CSE-253 Neural Networks & Pattern Recognition

This repo contains source code of all 4 homeworks and 1 project. (Still working on code organization).

## Homework 1 [Logistic & Softmax Regression via Gradient Descent](https://github.com/yrbszhsh/CSE-253/blob/Porj/Logistic%20and%20Softmax%20Regression%20via%20Gradient%20Descent.ipynb)





## Homework 2
Including neural networks for digit recognition based on softmax regression.

Structure: Input layer + Hidden layer (1) + Output layer
